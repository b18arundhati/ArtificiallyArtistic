## Contents of this repository
The folder **_Artistic Rendering of 2D images using CNN_**  contains an implementation of the paper [*_A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style_* by Leon A. Gatys,Alexander S. Ecker,Matthias Bethge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v2.pdf?).<br />
A folder containing test cases and outputs is included inside it. <br />

The folder **_NaiveImplementation_** is an attempt to implement the paper [*_Separating Style and Content_* by Joshua B. Tenenbaum and William T. Freeman](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/NC120601.pdf). <br />
The necessary training data and test set is included alongwith. <br />

The folder **_Doodles_**  contains an implementation of the paper [*_Semantic Style Transfer and Turning Two-Bit Doodles into Fine Artwork_* by Alex J. Champandard](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01768v1.pdf) <br />
A folder containing test outputs is included inside it. <br />

The folder **_Artistic rendering of videos_** is an attempt to implement the paper [*_Artistic style transfer for videos_* by Manuel Ruder, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.08610v2.pdf) <br />
A folder containing a test case  is included inside it. <br />






## Tasks

## Explanation of the approaches
### Naive approach :
Using bilinear model to separate the style and content of image and then applying the style of one image on the content of another image (by the principle of extrapolation).
### Using CNN :
We have used the VGG-19 model to achieve separation of style and content of image
### Neural Doodle
Using a deep neural network to borrow the skills of real artists and turn  two-bit doodles into masterpieces! (based on the Neural Patches algorithm (Li, 2016). )

### Artistic Videos
The algorithm allows to transfer the style from one image (for example, a painting) to a whole video sequence and generates consistent and stable stylized video sequences.

## Running 
### For the naive implementation
python BilinearClassifier.py
### For the CNN method
`python neural_style.py --content <content file> --styles <style file> --output <output file>`

(run `python neural_style.py --help` to see a list of all options)

### For neural doodle
`python3 doodle.py --style <style file> --content <content file> --output <output file> --device=gpu0 --phases=4 --iterations=80`

### For videos
`th artistic_video.lua --style_image<style file> --content_pattern<content frames>`





## Requirements

* TensorFlow
* SciPy
* Pillow
* NumPy
* Pre-trained VGG network (MD5 `8ee3263992981a1d26e73b3ca028a123`)
* Lasagne(for neural doodle)
* lua(for artistic videos)
* torch(for artistic videos)

Due to the huge size of the VGG network,it could not be pushed to github. It can be downloaded here(http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat).
